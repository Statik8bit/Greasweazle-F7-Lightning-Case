# Greasweazle-F7-Lightning-Case

I created this to hold my F7 Lighting and 3.5" floppy, I share it here in case someone else would like one. I finished the top and added it too.

*Make sure you do not connect both external and internal power to the 5V line at the same time.  I intend to install a switch to do this someday.
